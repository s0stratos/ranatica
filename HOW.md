# HOW TO SIMULATE IMMERSION LEARNING AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE

Learning any language requires some sort of **immersion**.

What I mean by that is language learning requires **bootstrapping 
and reinforcing** all sorts of language behaviors which are 
deeply rooted in all sort of:
- social interactions 
- emotional connections 
- repeating experiences 
- connections between sensory input or proprioception and language production

Some of these behaviors may be more grammatical (as in core-grammatical) 
some more lexical (as in word choice) but ultimately the difference for the learner who wants 
to produce native-like language is not very relevant. 

So the question is this, how to do that with an ancient language.
