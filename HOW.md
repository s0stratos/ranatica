# HOW TO SIMULATE IMMERSION LEARNING AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE

Learning any language requires some sort of **immersion**.

What I mean by that is language learning requires **bootstrapping 
and reinforcing** all sorts of language behaviors which are 
deeply rooted in all sort of:
- social interactions 
- emotional connections 
- repeating experiences 
- connections between sensory input or proprioception and language production

Some of these behaviors may be more grammatical (as in core-grammatical) 
some more lexical (as in word choice) but ultimately the difference for the learner who wants 
to produce native-like language is not very relevant. 

So the question is this, how to do that with an ancient language.

## INTERACTIONS 

Language production is heavily interactional.

This means:
- being able to react in the proper manner to an interaction initiated by someone else.
- being able to initiate an interaction

### Conclusion: 
use drama

## REPEATING EXPERIENCES

Learning need repetition and the more something repeats the more codified and normal it should seem.

### Conclusion: 
- use drama and collect similar sentences and watch them together
- don't use too many different stages of the language

## EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS 

We learn by copying people and things we are interested in.

### Conclusion: 
feel what you read. try to find stuff that you deeply engage in. drama or other text where you can get interested in the way a character talk in 1st person is best

## SENSORY INPUT

Mapping sensory input with lexical choice 

### Conclusion: 
don't be afraid to do stuff like picture games; connect what you learn to everyday experiences

## PROPRIOCEPTION 

Same as external sensory input 

### Conclusion: 
connect what you learn to everyday experiences

## WHAT KIDS DO 

Overplaying analogy and undo it later when they realize it's actually not done this way

### Conclusion:  
- look for actual patterns you can reuse and generalize ; don't be afraid to generalize them but if you find it's not actually done that way, change it to what you see. 
- don't use too many different stages of the language
