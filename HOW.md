# HOW TO SIMULATE IMMERSION LEARNING AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE

Learning any language requires some sort of **immersion**.

What I mean by that is language learning requires **bootstrapping 
and reinforcing** all sorts of language behaviors which are 
deeply rooted in all sort of:
- social interactions 
- emotional connections 
- repeating experiences 
- connections between sensory input or proprioception and language production

Some of these behaviors may be more grammatical (as in core-grammatical) 
some more lexical (as in word choice) but ultimately the difference for the learner who wants 
to produce native-like language is not very relevant. 

So the question is this, how to do that with an ancient language.

## INTERACTIONS 

Language production is heavily interactional.

This means:
- being able to react in the proper manner to an interaction initiated by someone else.
- being able to initiate an interaction

### Conclusion: 
use drama

## REPEATING EXPERIENCES

Learning need repetition and the more something repeats the more codified and normal it should seem.

### Conclusion: 
- use drama and collect similar sentences and watch them together
- don't use too many different stages of the language

## COGNITIVE CULTURAL JOURNEY

We learn a language not simply by projecting categories from other languages
onto it but by navigating the cultural space of that language. Concepts,
idioms, fine lexicon structure (antonyms, synonyms, derivation), lexical 
and grammatical expectations (being able to complete / finish a cut sentence) 
are all very important aspects of language acquisition

## EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS 

We learn by copying people and things we are interested in.

### Conclusion: 
feel what you read. try to find stuff that you deeply engage in. drama or other text where you can get interested in the way a character talk in 1st person is best

## SENSORY INPUT

Mapping sensory input with lexical choice 

### Conclusion: 
don't be afraid to do stuff like picture games; connect what you learn to everyday experiences

## PROPRIOCEPTION 

Same as external sensory input 

### Conclusion: 
connect what you learn to everyday experiences

## WHAT KIDS DO 

Overplaying analogy and undo it later when they realize it's actually not done this way

### Conclusion:  
- look for actual patterns you can reuse and generalize ; don't be afraid to generalize them but if you find it's not actually done that way, change it to what you see. 
- don't use too many different stages of the language
