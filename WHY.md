# WHY 

I decided to separate the why part of the README from the what...

... because some of could be interested in the what and even want to contribute to it while disagreeing with the why.

So why such a focus on comedy and late 3rd and 2nd century BC latin.

There are many answers to this question

So let's start.


## LATIN AS A LIVING LANGUAGE

A large part of what it is to learn a language is being able to interact in it...

... To perform speech acts 

... To use the expected idiom when you don't want to attract attention to how you say things but just say it

The early latin corpus thanks to comedy is the best corpus there is to learn this.


## LANGUAGE COHERENCE

You can learn to speak a language that evolved over 800 years or more.

If you don't commit to speak a language as it was spoken for a subset of that time, you end up speaking nothing.

Even if you wish to learn "classical latin", that is 1st century BC latin,
the late 3rd and 2nd century BC latin will have to be your reference for interactional latin.


## IDIOMATIC LANGUAGE AND THE RIGHT EXPRESSION 

Expressivity and non-expressivity are two important aspects of speech.

You don't want to be expressive or smart all the time.

Most of the time you want the most normal expression and idiom for the job.

Comedy is very important for this cause it feature a lot of situations and interactions
with very normal wordings.

## COMEDY IN A LIVING ART 

Unlike other texts which are meant to be read and enjoyed alone, 
comedy is meant to be played and shared
listened to by a crowd

it makes it a very important entry point into Roman culture and
I can only wish we had more renditions of it, 
songs we can all sing from it.
