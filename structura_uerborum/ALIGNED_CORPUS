Who’s braver—or more reckless—than me? I know exactly what young guys are like, and here I am wandering around alone in the middle of the night. What if the Board of Three grabbed me and threw me in jail? Tomorrow I’d be dragged out and whipped like some sack in storage. I wouldn’t get a chance to defend myself, my master wouldn’t help, and everyone would say I totally had it coming. Eight big guys pounding on me like I’m an anvil—what a welcome home after being abroad. And it’s all because my master can’t control himself.
Who could be crazier than me? I know how wild young men can be, yet I’m still walking around alone at night. What would happen if the Board of Three decided to arrest me? They’d haul me out tomorrow and beat me like a piece of scrap metal. No defense, no help from my master, and everyone would think I deserved every blow. Eight heavy hitters smashing away at me—some homecoming from my travels. My master’s lack of restraint is what put me in this mess.
Honestly, who’s dumber or gutsier than me? I know perfectly well how rowdy kids get, and I’m still out here by myself in the middle of the night. What if the Board of Three grabbed me and tossed me in a cell? Tomorrow I’d be dragged out and whipped like a tool in a workshop. I wouldn’t get to say a word in my defense, my master wouldn’t lift a finger, and everyone would assume I earned the beating. Eight huge guys hammering away at me—some “welcome back” after being abroad. And the whole thing is thanks to my master’s total lack of self-control.
