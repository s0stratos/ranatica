# INTRODUCTION TO LATIN GRAMMAR

This is a really short introduction to latin grammar.

## THE VERB

Verbs in latin a primarily characterized by having a **mood**.

They are also typically inflected for **tense**.

### MOODS

Latin verbs have 3 finite moods :
- INDICATIVE
- SUBJUNCTIVE
- IMPERATIVE

And 1 non-finite mood :
- INFINITIVE 

Latin also has participles :
- PRESENT (NT) - ACTIVE
- FUTURE (ÙR) - ACTIVE
- PAST (TU) - VARIABLE ([see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT))
- ND PARTICIPLE (ND) - PASSIVE

Finally, latin also has different verbal nouns, whose forms are reminiscent of some participles.
- SUPINE (TU)
- GERUNDIVE (ND)
- IO FORMS _(EARLY LATIN)_

Finite forms are inflected for **person**.

Participles are inflected for **subject agreement**

| TYPE         | MORPHOLOGY                                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FINITE FORMS | MOOD, TENSE, PERSON, (ALIGNMENT [see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT)) |
| INFINITIVE   | TENSE, (ALIGNMENT [see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT))               |
| VERBAL NOUN  | CASE                                                                 |
| PARTICIPLE   | TENSE, SUBJECT AGREEMENT                                             |  

### ALIGNMENT

If you observe latin verbs in general, you'll see both "active"-forms and a "r"-forms exist.

This is a property of the verbs to either have both types of forms or only "r"-forms.

Verbs that only have "r"-forms are called deponent verbs.

"Deponent" just means that those verbs give up on having "active" forms.

The patterns are the following:

|                        | ACTIVE VERBS WITH A DIRECT OBJECT                                                                 | DEPONENT VERBS WITH A DIRECT OBJECT                                                                              |

The past participle in -tu/-su in the most loosely correlative with the rest of the verb behavior

The general case is that **being part of the same paradigms as finite forms they follow the same behavior as the finite r-forms**.
But there are actually **lexical exceptions** to this.

### CONJUGATION / AGREEMENT

## ROOT CLAUSES

### INDICATIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### SUBJUNCTIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### IMPERATIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### INFINITIVE ROOT CLAUSES

## NON CLAUSAL COMPLEMENTS

## VERBLESS CLAUSES

#### INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS

## EMBEDDED CLAUSES

Latin has both finite and non-finite embedded clauses

### NON-FINITE 

#### SUBJECT + INFINITIVE CLAUSES

#### SUPINE CLAUSES

#### ND-FORMS CLAUSES

### FINITE 

Finite embedded clauses can only have **Indicative or Subjunctive mood**.
The Imperative is strictly a main clause mood.

#### RELATIVE CLAUSES - (INDICATIVE OR SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### INTERROGATIVE CLAUSES - (MOSTLY SUBJUNCTIVE) 

#### EXCLAMATIVE CLAUSES - (MOSTLY SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### BARE SUBJUNCTIVE CLAUSES - (SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### FINAL COMPLEMENT CLAUSES - (SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### ADJUNCTS CLAUSES INTRODUCED BY A CONJUNCTION - (INDICATIVE OR SUBJUNCTIVE)
