# INTRODUCTION TO LATIN GRAMMAR

This is a really short introduction to latin grammar.

## THE VERB

Verbs in latin a primarily characterized by having a **mood**.

They are also typically inflected for **tense**.

### MOODS

Latin verbs have 3 finite moods :
- INDICATIVE
- SUBJUNCTIVE
- IMPERATIVE

And 1 non-finite mood :
- INFINITIVE 

Latin also has participles :
- PRESENT (NT) - ACTIVE
- FUTURE (ÙR) - ACTIVE
- PAST (TU) - VARIABLE ([see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT))
- ND PARTICIPLE (ND) - PASSIVE

Finally, latin also has different verbal nouns, whose forms are reminiscent of some participles.
- SUPINE (TU)
- GERUNDIVE (ND)
- IO FORMS _(EARLY LATIN)_

Finite forms are inflected for **person**.

Participles are inflected for **subject agreement**

| TYPE         | MORPHOLOGY                                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FINITE FORMS | MOOD, TENSE, PERSON, (ALIGNMENT [see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT)) |
| INFINITIVE   | TENSE, (ALIGNMENT [see alignment section](#ALIGNMENT))               |
| VERBAL NOUN  | CASE                                                                 |
| PARTICIPLE   | TENSE, SUBJECT AGREEMENT                                             |  

### ALIGNMENT

If you observe latin verbs in general, you'll see both "active"-forms and a "r"-forms exist.

This is a property of the verbs to either have both types of forms or only "r"-forms.

Verbs that only have "r"-forms are called deponent verbs.

"Deponent" just means that those verbs give up on having "active" forms.

The patterns are the following:

|                        | ACTIVE VERBS WITH A DIRECT OBJECT                                                                 | DEPONENT VERBS WITH A DIRECT OBJECT                                                                              |

|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| FINITE FORMS - ACTIVE  | X[nominative] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)    | DOESNT EXIST                           |
| FINITE FORMS - R-FORMS | (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)                  | X[nominative] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)      |
| INFINITIVE - ACTIVE    | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)             | DOESNT EXIST                           |
| INFINITIVE - R-FORMS   | (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)                  | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)               |
| VERBAL NOUN            | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)             | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)               |
| PARTICIPLE             | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)             | X[-] (OTHER COMPLEMENTS)               |

The past participle in -tu/-su in the most loosely correlative with the rest of the verb behavior

The general case is that **being part of the same paradigms as finite forms they follow the same behavior as the finite r-forms**.
But there are actually **lexical exceptions** to this.

### TENSES

Latin tense system has 2 intricated layers:
- the imperfectum / perfectum distinction.
- the tense distinctions within it

INFINITIVE : only imperfectum/perfectum distinction
IMPERATIVE : only imperfectum - present/future distinction only
SUBJUNCTIVE: imperfectum/perfectum distinction - present / imperfect distinction only + sigmatic form
INDICATIVE : imperfectum/perfectum distinction - present / imperfect / future distinction + sigmatic form 

|             | IMPERFECTUM/PERFECTUM | PRESENT/IMPERFECT | SIGMATIC FORM | PRESENT/FUTURE      |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| INFINITIVE  | YES                   | NO (only present) | NO            | NO (via participle) |
| IMPERATIVE  | NO (only imperfectum) | NO (only present) | NO            | YES                 |
| SUBJUNCTIVE | YES                   | YES               | YES           | NO (only present)   |
| INDICATIVE  | YES                   | YES               | YES           | YES                 |

Of those distinction the imperfectum/perfectum one is lexical as seen by the fact that some verbs
don't have imperfectum forms and generalized perfectum forms. The perfectum forms of those verbs
act like regular imperfectum forms (in a manner reminiscent of deponent verbs).

|             | NUMBER OF FORM SETS | NUMBER OF IMPERFECTUM FORM SETS | NUMBER OF PERFECTUM FORM SETS |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| INFINITIVE  | 2                   | 1                               | 1                             |
| IMPERATIVE  | 2                   | 2                               | 0                             |
| SUBJUNCTIVE | 2*2+1 = 5           | 2 + 1                           | 2                             |
| INDICATIVE  | 2*3 + 1 = 7         | 3 + 1                           | 3                             |


### AGREEMENT

## ROOT CLAUSES

### INDICATIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### SUBJUNCTIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### IMPERATIVE ROOT CLAUSES

### INFINITIVE ROOT CLAUSES

## NON CLAUSAL COMPLEMENTS

## VERBLESS CLAUSES

#### INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS

The main difference between infinitive complements and infinitive clauses in latin is that:
- The subject interpretation is fixed by the main verb.
- The tense of the infinitive is fixed by the tense of the main verb.

- uenire nequeo.
- *uenisse nequeo.
- *eum uenisse nequeo.

## EMBEDDED CLAUSES

Latin has both finite and non-finite embedded clauses

### NON-FINITE 

#### SUBJECT + INFINITIVE CLAUSES

#### SUPINE CLAUSES

#### ND-FORMS CLAUSES

### FINITE 

Finite embedded clauses can only have **Indicative or Subjunctive mood**.
The Imperative is strictly a main clause mood.

#### RELATIVE CLAUSES - (INDICATIVE OR SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### INTERROGATIVE CLAUSES - (MOSTLY SUBJUNCTIVE) 

#### EXCLAMATIVE CLAUSES - (MOSTLY SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### BARE SUBJUNCTIVE CLAUSES - (SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### FINAL COMPLEMENT CLAUSES - (SUBJUNCTIVE)

#### ADJUNCTS CLAUSES INTRODUCED BY A CONJUNCTION - (INDICATIVE OR SUBJUNCTIVE)
