OSCI GEMINI
-----------




A bunch of non-latin speaking kids (oscan and etruscan maybe?) from defeated cities during the Bellum Sociale are brought as slaves to Rome and sold to a rich Roman and there dream to learn latin to become actors and play comedy.

it would be fun if it starts itself looking more and more like a comedy plot
like the master's son coming home real depressed one day
and it's basically a classic love plot

make the foreigners women and triplets
sure
or do it like in stichus
make people think it's about learning
then revert to a love plot
put something in between


this book was never about learning latin
it was in fact about learning oscan!
plot twist
