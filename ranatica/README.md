# WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING HERE ?

Eh that's an excellent question. I am writing the following for two reasons:

- because I am constantly encountering situations 
where people don't follow at all what I will try to outline below and this
has repeatedly been a source of frustration for me.
- because a friend called me out on this saying if I could not explain it in detail
then my argument and frustration was devoid of meaning.

Writing this will be long and hard, not because I am not confident in what
I am trying to convey but because it may get abstract or technical
or complex very quickly.

## BUT WHAT IS THIS?

I guess the question can be stated as :

" how to deal with latin being a dead language when 
you are trying to either:
- write/speak latin that really follows ancient **grammar** and **usage**.
- trying to **describe latin grammar and usage** to help people write or speak it. "

and more specifically:

- Not being able to **access speaker competence** directly through **elicitation** or **judgments**.
- Having access to **an incomplete and not very large corpus**.
- Having access to a **heterogeneous corpus with variation through time and space**. 

At this point I want to come back quickly to **corpus work**, **elicitation** and **grammatical/usage judgments**.

When you are trying to learn or describe a language you basically rely on those 3 things:

- **Corpus Work** is the observation of production you have no part in and cannot interact with. Like observing 2 people greet each other.
- **Elicitation** is the observation of production you can prompt yourself. Like greeting someone and observe his reaction.
- **Judgment** is the observation of what people have to say about language productions. Like asking someone if how you greet him is the right way to do it. 

While these are different tools you can see that unless you are fishing information 
about very rare or specific contexts, you should be able to access the same pieces 
of information through the 3 tools. Note that judgements and elicitation are generally
much more confident when the situation is not super unlikely or the structure extremely
rare and likely to be out-competed by other options anyway.

Last point, you saw me distinguish between grammar and usage above and while the difference may somewhat be fuzzy, 
I will start from the following intuition. Grammar is about building utterances than should work **structurally**
as communication units and have at least some clear **literal meaning** derived from its form. Usage on the other 
hand captures the idea that even a valid utterance with a clear meaning can be really surprising or bring the
communication to failure and awkwardness. Like greeting someone "Good heath to you!" in modern English.

## WHY A CONSTRUCTION BASED APPROACH

the best level of language description for or language observation is not the word.

It's a unit large enough to convey a precise meaning.

But it's also a unit that actually repeats or can be reapplied in other context with 
the appropriate variable adjustments.

So you don't want individuals words: not information enough for learners.
You don't want full finished sentences with all their specificities: cannot be reused.

You want abstractions in the middle.

But you are gonna say... what abstraction like idioms? 
grammatical abstractions like sentence types? sentences featuring specific connectors 
that influence how they are used in discourse?

All of it. Then you realize that each individual sentence actually feature not only a unique
combination of words but a unique combination of constructions of all kind.

In a sense, construction here means anything but make sure that we realize that there is level
of linguistic description that is quite abstract and need to be addressed consciously or not
by learners.

A sentence like "Hey why wouldn't you do this?" can thus be taken as teaching us aspects of
many different constructions of English. 

- The construction "utterances introduced by Hey".
- The construction "interrogative sentences"
- The construction "negative sentence"
- The construction "negative questioning utterance"
- The construction "why questions"
- The construction "sentence with would modal verb"
...

Some of those constructions could be reduced to discussing the use of specific words (would, hey) 
or grammatical features while cannot be discussed at a lower level (use of negative questions)

This is why the Ranatica approaches linguistic phenomena the same one by grouping together
utterances that share some construction to give the reader a sense of the **extension**, **meaning** and
**productivity** of the structure. as well as how it may be influenced by other co-occurring constructions.

The quick outtake I want you to consider is :

When dealing with the question "how to say this in latin", the right question should be 
what sets of constructions are most likely to pop naturally in the head of speakers.

What idioms? What grammatical structures? What sentence types? What connectors are likely 
to fit the bill for that speech act. This doesn't need to be conscious effort all the time of course.
But it can very well be as part of a learner's effort.

Last point, why does the Ranatica prefers to just collect full utterances and present them next to
each other rather that introducing constructions abstractly with a nice usage description. Because the
best way to learn proper usage is to see or try to use those constructions in context a lot 
(grouped together for that very purpose) rather than learning them abstractly for abstract patterns
and explanations.

## GRAMMAR AND USAGE 

## HOW DO YOU GENERALIZE WHEN DATA IS FRAGMENTARY

## GENERALIZATIONS, DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES

## THE USE OF CALQUES FROM MODERN LANGUAGES

I have a general dislike for calques. 
Not because I was personally hurt by them but because the use of calques 
is one of the least faithful way possible to approach the need to generalize
on fragmentary data.
