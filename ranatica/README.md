# WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING HERE ?

Eh that's an excellent question. I am writing the following for two reasons:

- because I am constantly encountering situations 
where people don't follow at all what I will try to outline below and this
has repeatedly been a source of frustration for me.
- because a friend called me out on this saying if I could not explain it in detail
then my argument and frustration was devoid of meaning.

Writing this will be long and hard, not because I am not confident in what
I am trying to convey but because it may get abstract or technical
or complex very quickly.

## BUT WHAT IS THIS?

I guess the question can be stated as :

" how to deal with latin being a dead language when 
you are trying to either:
- write/speak latin that really follows ancient **grammar** and **usage**.
- trying to **describe latin grammar and usage** to help people write or speak it. "

and more specifically:

- Not being able to **access speaker competence** directly through **elicitation** or **judgments**.
- Having access to **an incomplete and not very large corpus**.
- Having access to a **heterogeneous corpus with variation through time and space**. 

At this point I want to come back quickly to **corpus work**, **elicitation** and **grammatical/usage judgments**.

When you are trying to learn or describe a language you basically rely on those 3 things:

- **Corpus Work** is the observation of production you have no part in and cannot interact with. Like observing 2 people greet each other.
- **Elicitation** is the observation of production you can prompt yourself. Like greeting someone and observe his reaction.
- **Judgment** is the observation of what people have to say about language productions. Like asking someone if how you greet him is the right way to do it. 

While these are different tools you can see that unless you are fishing information 
about very rare or specific contexts, you should be able to access the same pieces 
of information through the 3 tools. Note that judgements and elicitation are generally
much more confident when the situation is not super unlikely or the structure extremely
rare and likely to be out-competed by other options anyway.

Last point, you saw me distinguish between grammar and usage above and while the difference may somewhat be fuzzy, 
I will start from the following intuition. Grammar is about building utterances than should work **structurally**
as communication units and have at least some clear **literal meaning** derived from its form. Usage on the other 
hand captures the idea that even a valid utterance with a clear meaning can be really surprising or bring the
communication to failure and awkwardness. Like greeting someone "Good heath to you!" in modern English.

## WHY A CONSTRUCTION BASED APPROACH

## GRAMMAR AND USAGE 

## HOW DO YOU GENERALIZE WHEN DATA IS FRAGMENTARY

## GENERALIZATIONS, DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES

## THE USE OF CALQUES FROM MODERN LANGUAGES

I have a general dislike for calques. 
Not because I was personally hurt by them but because the use of calques 
is one of the least faithful way possible to approach the need to generalize
on fragmentary data.
