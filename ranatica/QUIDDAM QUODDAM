QUIDDAM/QUODDAM in comoediis

QUIDDAM/QUODDAM = there is a precise thing which i know which one is it and i could say more about it. (same for the rest of the DAM series quidam, cuidam, ..)

Very different from aliquid which does not suggest a precise object or event that the speak refers too and could describe more.


surgedum huc igitur. consulere quiddam est quod tecum uolo.
 get up. there is something i need to tell you about
[NIC] quid me uis? [PHI] pudet dicere me tibi quiddam. [NIC] quid est quod pudeat?
 what do you want? there is something i am ashamed to tell you. what is it?
[THA] quid feceras? [CHA] paullum quiddam.
 what did you do (to run away like this)? a small something.
[CH] qua facie est homo? [S] sesquipede quiddamst quam tu longior.
 what does he look like? he's a something 1 foot and a half taller than you.
ego me in pedes quantum queo in angiportum quoddam desertum, inde item in aliud, inde in aliud.
 i rush as much as i can in a first empty alley, then another just the same way, then another
audi modo. est mihi ultimis conclave in aedibus quoddam retro: huc est intro latu' lectu', uestimentis stratus est
 just listen. there is a room with a key in the back of my house. inside it is a large bed. it's covered with sheets.

notice none of these are like "any room" "whatever room" but "there is/was THIS particular thing i could show or describe to you more"
